## Project Description
- **Background**: Cassava is a key crop for food security across Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, viral diseases threaten cassava yields, and are costly to detect manually.
- As a midterm group project for DATA2040, this project fine-tunes a series of CNN models to accurately detect cassava leaf diseases, using image augmentation and transfer learning to increase classification accuracy.
- **Why?**: Fine-tuned deep learning models may help identify diseased cassava plants more efficiently and ultimately prevent crop loss.
- The data consists of 21,367 labeled images of cassava leaves belonging to five different categories - four different disease categories and one category for healthy plants. The images were crowdsourced from farmers in Uganda and labeled by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. The data and task was made available as a Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification). 
- **Result**: Using image augmentation and transfer learning we increased our accuracy from a baseline 61.5% (majority classifier) to 80% (DenseNet201 model).
